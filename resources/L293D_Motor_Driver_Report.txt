Report on L293D Motor Driver

1. Introduction

The L293D is a dual H-Bridge motor driver IC commonly used to control
the direction and speed of DC motors and stepper motors. It allows
microcontrollers (like Arduino, PIC, STM32, etc.) to drive motors
without being directly connected to high current loads. The IC provides
bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA per channel at voltages
ranging from 4.5V to 36V.

2. IC Overview

-   Package: 16-pin Dual In-line Package (DIP) or Surface Mount (SOIC).
-   Voltage Supply:
    -   Logic voltage (Vcc1): 4.5V–7V
    -   Motor supply voltage (Vcc2): 4.5V–36V
-   Current Capability: 600 mA continuous per channel (peak 1.2 A for
    short time).
-   Protection: Built-in diodes for back-EMF protection from inductive
    loads.

The L293D integrates two H-Bridge circuits in one chip, enabling control
of two DC motors independently.

3. Internal ICs and Blocks Used

The L293D internally consists of: 1. Darlington Pair Transistors: Each
output driver uses Darlington transistors to provide high current gain.
2. H-Bridge Circuit: Each motor channel has four transistors configured
as an H-Bridge, allowing current to flow in both directions.
3. Logic Gates & Enable Pins: Control inputs from a microcontroller are
processed to set the motor’s direction and ON/OFF state.
4. Clamp Diodes: Protect against voltage spikes generated by inductive
loads like motors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. The H-Bridge Concept

An H-Bridge is an arrangement of four switches (or transistors) that
allows voltage to be applied across a load in either direction.

-   When S1 & S4 are closed, current flows one way → motor rotates
    clockwise.
-   When S2 & S3 are closed, current flows the opposite way → motor
    rotates counterclockwise.
-   When both pairs are open → motor stops.

This is the fundamental principle used in the L293D to control motor
direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for Speed Control

-   PWM is used to control motor speed by rapidly switching the motor ON
    and OFF.
-   The duty cycle of the PWM signal determines the average voltage
    applied:
    -   Higher duty cycle → faster motor speed.
    -   Lower duty cycle → slower motor speed.
-   The L293D doesn’t generate PWM itself; instead, a microcontroller
    provides a PWM signal on the Enable pins (EN1/EN2) to regulate motor
    speed.

6. Pin Configuration

-   Pin 1 (Enable 1,2): Enables Motor 1 (connect PWM here).
-   Pin 2 & 7 (Input 1,2): Control direction of Motor 1.
-   Pin 3 & 6 (Output 1,2): Connect to Motor 1 terminals.
-   Pin 9 (Enable 3,4): Enables Motor 2 (connect PWM here).
-   Pin 10 & 15 (Input 3,4): Control direction of Motor 2.
-   Pin 11 & 14 (Output 3,4): Connect to Motor 2 terminals.
-   Pin 4,5,12,13 (GND): Ground.
-   Pin 8 (Vcc2): Motor supply voltage (4.5–36V).
-   Pin 16 (Vcc1): Logic supply (5V).

7. Applications

-   Controlling DC motors in robots and automation systems.
-   Driving stepper motors in CNC machines and 3D printers.
-   Motorized toys and robotic arms.
-   Smart car, drone, and conveyor belt applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Advantages

-   Compact solution (two H-Bridges in one chip).
-   Handles up to 36V motor voltage.
-   Built-in back EMF diodes.
-   Widely supported in robotics and Arduino projects.

Limitations:
- Current limited to 600 mA (not suitable for high-power motors).
- Generates heat at higher loads, requiring heat sinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Conclusion

The L293D Motor Driver IC is a widely used component in embedded systems
and robotics for controlling small to medium DC motors. Its integration
of dual H-Bridges, enable pins for PWM speed control, and internal
protection features make it ideal for beginner and intermediate motor
control applications.
