# Social Engineering — Simple Report

## 1. What is Social Engineering?
Social engineering is a way criminals trick people into giving away
personal information or access to systems.  
Instead of breaking into computers with code, they **manipulate human trust**.  
In short: it’s hacking people, not machines.

## 2. Common Tricks Used
- **Phishing**: Fake emails or texts that look real, asking you to click a link or share passwords.  
- **Vishing**: Phone calls pretending to be from your bank, government, or company.  
- **Pretexting**: Creating a fake story to get details (like pretending to be IT support).  
- **Baiting**: Offering something tempting (like a free USB drive or download) that hides malware.  
- **Tailgating**: Following an employee into a secure office by acting friendly or rushed.

## 3. Everyday Examples
- You get an email that looks like your bank, asking you to “reset” your account.  
- Someone calls saying they are from tech support and need your password.  
- A stranger politely asks you to hold the door at work so they can “get in quickly.”

## 4. Why It’s a Big Problem
- People can lose **money**.  
- Companies can suffer **data leaks**.  
- Personal information like IDs or credit cards can be stolen.  
- Trust and reputation get damaged when people fall for scams.

## 5. How to Stay Safe
- **Pause and think** before clicking links or opening attachments.  
- **Double-check** who is contacting you — call the company back on official numbers.  
- **Never share** passwords, PINs, or OTPs.  
- **Report** strange messages or calls to IT/security teams.  
- Use **strong passwords** and, if possible, **two-factor authentication**.

## 6. Final Thoughts
Social engineering works because humans are naturally helpful and trusting.  
The best defense is awareness:  
- Be alert,  
- Ask questions,  
- And trust your gut when something feels off.  

A little caution can save a lot of trouble.
